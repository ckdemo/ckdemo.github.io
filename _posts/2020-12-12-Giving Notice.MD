In this full-length, 72,000+ word sequel to The New Job, we rejoin Max, a gay nineteen year-old golden retriever, plus friends Stephen, Corey, Seventeen, Connie, Mr. Warren, and many more diverse, kinky residents of StartAgain Manor, to pick up right where The New Job left off!

Maxwell Covington's life was turned upside down when, out of boredom and loneliness, he applied for a vague but intriguing job posting. The job he was offered turned out to be like nothing Max could've expected, and now he lives in mysterious mansion where the residents are free to explore their wildest fantasies and most secret fetishes with each other. Max, who had always struggled with feelings of shame toward his fetish for diapers and ageplay, bondage, chastity and more, is finally beginning to embrace who he is. And he's finally beginning to find real happiness and a sense of belonging.

Max's relationship with his new boyfriend, handsome wolf daddy Stephen, is thriving; his work on Mr. Warren's library restoration team is turning out to be his dream job; and in his off-hours he gets up to all sorts of diapered mischief with his 'baby bro' Corey and lots of other new friends. For Max, this newfound sense of acceptance and belonging is life-changing. Max's life has become something extraordinary, and things couldn't be going better for the canine...

...until it all begins to fall apart, when a coworker physically assaults Max and takes pictures of him dressed like a big toddler. The bully threatens to send the compromising photos to Max's conservative parents, unless he agrees to immediately give notice and quit his new job. But that would mean giving up his friends, giving up his home, and going back to his unhappy, empty life at Bay City University.

With his back to a corner and time running out, Max and friends scramble to find a solution that will free him from the bully's trap. Will he be forced to sacrifice everything? Or can Max save himself, before his relationship with his family is damaged irreparably?

Plus, Giving Notice includes a bonus short story, Jackson's Reward! Husky IT expert Jackson Young managed to prevent a DDoS attack from shutting down StartAgain Manor's computer network. In gratitude, the mysterious Master of the manor orders Jackson to report to the weight room for a reward. But, when the mansion's resident personal trainer, a sexy boar named Rex, begins restraining Jackson to one of the weight benches, the horny husky discovers that there's a lot more to his reward than he expected!
