In this full-length, 53,000 word novel, a furry named Max (a gay 19-year-old golden retriever), applies to a mysterious help wanted ad in an effort to break up the boredom of his first year of college. Little does he realize the unusual, sexually charged duties his new job entails. Will fear and self-doubt force Max to back out of this unexpected new life? Or will he follow his heart (and his cock) and let handsome wolf Stephen lead him into a strange new world?

A diverse cast of characters teach Max the joys of embracing his secret fetishes for bondage, diapers, ageplay, chastity and more. Max meets furs of every species with their own kinks and fetishes, both cis and trans men, characters of various ethnicities and more as he explores the strange, diverse, wonderful, kink-filled world of his new employer, StartAgain.

Max has spent his life denying who he is inside, and he was left lonely and isolated because of self-loathing and fear of others' judgment. Will his strange new job lead to a greater sense of self-acceptance, or will the bizarreness of his new life prove too much for the lonely, uncertain golden retriever?

Plus, The New Job includes a bonus short story, Gishy's Big Day, set in the world of StartAgain Manor but featuring all-new characters! Red fox Gishy has spent three months working at StartAgain servicing the kink needs of others as part of the organization's Entertainment Division. But a secretive new mystery client turns out to be a dominant "Daddy" who pushes all Gishy's kink buttons simultaneously, leaving the poor humiliation-craving fox squirming for more and wondering how anyone could know his own desires and fetishes so completely.
